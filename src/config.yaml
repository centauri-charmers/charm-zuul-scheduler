      An SSH key that will be setup for the Zuul service to use at
      /var/lib/zuul/.ssh/id_rsa, the default that Zuul expects. This
      key will also be configured for nodepool authentication so should
      be added as a named keypair to your openstack with a name matching
      your nodepool configuration (defaults to 'nodepool').

      This integer is the maximum number of megabytes that any one
      job is allowed to consume on disk while it is running. If a
      jobâ€™s scratch space has more than this much space consumed, it
      will be aborted. Set to -1 to disable the limit.
