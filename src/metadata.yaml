summary: Zuul Scheduler Service

description: |
  The scheduler is the primary component of Zuul. The scheduler is not a
  scalable component; one, and only one, scheduler must be running at all
  times for Zuul to be operational. It receives events from any connections
  to remote systems which have been configured, enqueues items into
  pipelines, distributes jobs to executors, and reports results.
